# Kotlin DSL Migration Summary

This document summarizes the migration from Groovy build.gradle to Kotlin DSL build.gradle.kts for the Flutter plugin's Android module.

## Changes Made

1. **Renamed Files:**
   - `android/build.gradle` → `android/build.gradle.kts`
   - `android/settings.gradle` → `android/settings.gradle.kts`

2. **Key Differences in build.gradle.kts:**
   - Using `apply(plugin = "...")` syntax instead of `apply plugin: '...'`
   - Dependencies are added using `project.dependencies { add("implementation", ...) }`
   - Android configuration uses `android { ... }` block directly
   - Kotlin compile options configured via `tasks.withType<KotlinCompile>()`
   - Properties use `=` assignment operator

3. **Important Notes:**
   - Flutter embedding is handled automatically by Flutter build system
   - No need to explicitly add Flutter dependencies in plugin module
   - The plugin builds successfully when built from Flutter (e.g., from example app)

## Build Command
From the example directory:
```bash
flutter build apk
```

Or from android directory (for testing only):
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

Note: The android module alone won't build successfully as it needs Flutter dependencies which are injected during Flutter build process.
